Bus is a minimalist event/message bus implementation for internal communication.
It is heavily inspired from my [event_bus](https://github.com/otobus/event_bus)
package for Elixir language.

## Installation

Via go packages:
```go get github.com/mustafaturan/bus```

## Usage

### Configure

The package requires a unique id generator to assign ids to events. You can
write your own function to generate unique ids or use a package that provides
unique id generation functionality. Here is a sample configuration using
`monoton` id generator:

```go
import (
    "github.com/mustafaturan/bus"
    "github.com/mustafaturan/monoton"
    "github.com/mustafaturan/monoton/sequencer"
)

func init() {
    // configure id generator (it doesn't have to be monoton)
    node        := uint(1)
    initialTime := uint(0)
    monoton.Configure(sequencer.NewMillisecond(), node, initialTime)

    // configure bus
    if err := bus.Configure(bus.Config{Next: monoton.Next}); err != nil {
        panic("whoops")
    }
    // ...
}
```

### Register Event Topics

To emit events to the topics, topic names need to be registered first:

```go
func init() {
    // ...
    // register topics
    bus.RegisterTopics("order.received", "order.fulfilled")
    // ...
}
```

### Register Event Handlers

To receive topic events you need to register handlers; A handler basically
requires two vals which are a `Handle` function and topic `Matcher` regex
pattern.

```go
handler := bus.Handler{
    Handle: func(e *Event) {
        // do something
        // NOTE: Highly recommended to process the event in an async way
    },
    Matcher: ".*", // matches all topics
}
bus.RegisterHandler("a unique key for the handler", &handler)
```

### Emit Events

```go
txID  := "some-transaction-id-if-exists" // if it is blank, bus will generate one
topic := "order.received" // event topic name (must be registered before)
order := make(map[string]string) // interface{} data for event
order["orderID"]     = "123456"
order["orderAmount"] = "112.20"
order["currency"]    = "USD"

bus.Emit(topic, order, txID) // emit the event for the topic
```

### Processing Events

When an event is emitted, the topic handlers will receive events synchronously.
It is highly recommended to process events asynchronous. Package leave the
decision to the packages/projects to use concurrency abstractions depending on
use-cases.

### Sample Project

An [example simple project](https://github.com/mustafaturan/bus-sample-project)
with three consumers which increments a `counter` for each event topic,
`printer` consumer which prints all events and lastly `calculator` consumer
which sums amounts.

### Benchmarks

```

```
